### Patch Changes

- [#2233](https://github.com/graphcommerce-org/graphcommerce/pull/2233) [`f120bce`](https://github.com/graphcommerce-org/graphcommerce/commit/f120bce617808d756aebb7c500aa1deb9e4cf487) - Google Datalayer, Analytics and Tagmanager improvements.

  - Removed `eventFormat` as we could automatically detec the correct event format and it is now the responsibility of GTM or the GTAG to handle the event format.
  - Created cartItemToGoogleDatalayerItem and productToGoogleDatalayerItem for easier modifications. ([@paales](https://github.com/paales))
