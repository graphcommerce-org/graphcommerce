  title: Search API
  description: >
    The Algolia Search API lets you search, configure, and mange your indices and records.
    
    
    ## Client libraries
    
    
    Use Algolia's API clients and libraries to reliably integrate Algolia's APIs with your apps.
    
    The official API clients are covered by Algolia's [Service Level Agreement](https://www.algolia.com/policies/sla/).
    
    
    See: [Algolia's ecosystem](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/ecosystem/)
    
    
    ## Base URLs
    
    
    The base URLs for requests to the Search API are:
    
    
    - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}.algolia.net`
    
    - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-dsn.algolia.net`.
      If your subscription includes a [Distributed Search Network](https://dashboard.algolia.com/infra),
      this ensures that requests are sent to servers closest to users.
    
    Both URLs provide high availability by distributing requests with load balancing.
    
    
    **All requests must use HTTPS.**
    
    
    ## Retry strategy
    
    
    To guarantee a high availability, implement a retry strategy for all API requests using the URLs of your servers as fallbacks:
    
    
    - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-1.algolianet.com`
    
    - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-2.algolianet.com`
    
    - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-3.algolianet.com`
    
    
    These URLs use a different DNS provider than the primary URLs.
    
    You should randomize this list to ensure an even load across the three servers.
    
    
    All Algolia API clients implement this retry strategy.
    
    
    ## Authentication
    
    
    To authenticate your API requests, add these headers:
    
    
    - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application ID.
    
    - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the necessary permissions to make the request.
      The required access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in each endpoint's reference.
    
    You can find your application ID and API key in the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account).
    
    
    ## Request format
    
    
    Depending on the endpoint, request bodies are either JSON objects or arrays of JSON objects,
    
    
    ## Parameters
    
    
    Parameters are passed as query parameters for GET and DELETE requests,
    
    and in the request body for POST and PUT requests.
    
    
    Query parameters must be [URL-encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding).
    
    Non-ASCII characters must be UTF-8 encoded.
    
    Plus characters (`+`) are interpreted as spaces.
    
    Arrays as query parameters must be one of:
    
    
    - A comma-separated string: `attributesToRetrieve=title,description`
    
    - A URL-encoded JSON array: `attributesToRetrieve=%5B%22title%22,%22description%22%D`
    
    
    ## Response status and errors
    
    
    The Search API returns JSON responses.
    
    Since JSON doesn't guarantee any specific ordering, don't rely on the order of attributes in the API response.
    
    
    Successful responses return a `2xx` status. Client errors return a `4xx` status. Server errors are indicated by a `5xx` status.
    
    Error responses have a `message` property with more information.
    
    
    ## Version
    
    
    The current version of the Search API is version 1, as indicated by the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.

  - name: Indices
    description: >
      Manage your indices and index settings.
      
      
      Indices are copies of your data that are stored on Algolia's servers.
      
      They're optimal data structures for fast search and are made up of records and settings.

  - name: Records
    description: >
      Add, update, and delete records from your indices.
      
      
      Records are individual items in your index.
      
      When they match a search query, they're returned as search results, in the order determined by your ranking.
      
      Records are schemaless JSON objects.

    description: >
      Create, update, delete, and search for rules.
      
      
      Rules are _if-then_ statements that you can use to curate search results.
      
      Rules have _conditions_ which can trigger _consequences_.
      
      Consequences are changes to the search results, such as changing the order of search results, or boosting a facet.
      
      This can be useful for tuning specific queries or for merchandising.

        Filter expression to only include items that match the filter criteria in the response.
        
        
        You can use these filter expressions:
        
        
        - **Numeric filters.** `<facet> <op> <number>`, where `<op>` is one of `<`, `<=`, `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`.
        
        - **Ranges.** `<facet>:<lower> TO <upper>` where `<lower>` and `<upper>` are the lower and upper limits of the range (inclusive).
        
        - **Facet filters.** `<facet>:<value>` where `<facet>` is a facet attribute (case-sensitive) and `<value>` a facet value.
        
        - **Tag filters.** `_tags:<value>` or just `<value>` (case-sensitive).
        
        - **Boolean filters.** `<facet>: true | false`.
        
        
        You can combine filters with `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators with the following restrictions:
        
        
        - You can only combine filters of the same type with `OR`.
          **Not supported:** `facet:value OR num > 3`.
        - You can't use `NOT` with combinations of filters.
          **Not supported:** `NOT(facet:value OR facet:value)`
        - You can't combine conjunctions (`AND`) with `OR`.
          **Not supported:** `facet:value OR (facet:value AND facet:value)`
        
        Use quotes around your filters, if the facet attribute name or facet value has spaces, keywords (`OR`, `AND`, `NOT`), or quotes.
        
        If a facet attribute is an array, the filter matches if it matches at least one element of the array.
        
        
        For more information, see [Filters](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/filtering/).

      example: (category:Book OR category:Ebook) AND _tags:published
      x-categories:
        - Filtering
    facetFilters:
      description: >
        Filter the search by facet values, so that only records with the same facet values are retrieved.
        
        
        **Prefer using the `filters` parameter, which supports all filter types and combinations with boolean operators.**
        
        
        - `[filter1, filter2]` is interpreted as `filter1 AND filter2`.
        
        - `[[filter1, filter2], filter3]` is interpreted as `filter1 OR filter2 AND filter3`.
        
        - `facet:-value` is interpreted as `NOT facet:value`.
        
        
        While it's best to avoid attributes that start with a `-`, you can still filter them by escaping with a backslash:
        
        `facet:\-value`.

        Filters to promote or demote records in the search results.
        
        
        Optional filters work like facet filters, but they don't exclude records from the search results.
        
        Records that match the optional filter rank before records that don't match.
        
        If you're using a negative filter `facet:-value`, matching records rank after records that don't match.
        
        
        - Optional filters don't work on virtual replicas.
        
        - Optional filters are applied _after_ sort-by attributes.
        
        - Optional filters don't work with numeric attributes.

      example:
        - category:Book
        - author:John Doe

        - type: array

    numericFilters:
      description: >
        Filter by numeric facets.
        
        
        **Prefer using the `filters` parameter, which supports all filter types and combinations with boolean operators.**
        
        
        You can use numeric comparison operators: `<`, `<=`, `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`. Comparsions are precise up to 3 decimals.
        
        You can also provide ranges: `facet:<lower> TO <upper>`. The range includes the lower and upper boundaries.
        
        The same combination rules apply as for `facetFilters`.

      example:
        - - inStock = 1
          - deliveryDate < 1441755506
        - price < 1000

    tagFilters:

        **Prefer using the `filters` parameter, which supports all filter types and combinations with boolean operators.**
        
        
        Different from regular facets, `_tags` can only be used for filtering (including or excluding records).
        
        You won't get a facet count.
        
        The same combination and escaping rules apply as for `facetFilters`.

        Records with the same value for the `attributeForDistinct` attribute are considered a group.
        
        The `distinct` setting controls how many members of the group are returned.

            Snippets provide additional context to matched words.
            
            If you enable snippets, they include 10 words, including the matched word.
            
            The matched word will also be wrapped by HTML tags for highlighting.
            
            You can adjust the number of words with the following notation: `ATTRIBUTE:NUMBER`,
            
            where `NUMBER` is the number of words to be extracted.

            This setting sets a default list of languages used by the `removeStopWords` and `ignorePlurals` settings.
            
            This setting also sets a dictionary for word detection in the logogram-based [CJK](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/handling-natural-languages-nlp/in-depth/normalization/#normalization-for-logogram-based-languages-cjk) languages.
            
            To support this, you must place the CJK language **first**.
            
            
            **You should always specify a query language.**
            
            If you don't specify an indexing language, the search engine uses all [supported languages](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/handling-natural-languages-nlp/in-depth/supported-languages/),
            
            or the languages you specified with the `ignorePlurals` or `removeStopWords` parameters.

            Words that should be considered optional when found in the query.
            
            
            By default, records must match all words in the search query to be included in the search results.
            
            Adding optional words can help to increase the number of search results by running an additional search query that doesn't include the optional words.
            
            For example, if the search query is "action video" and "video" is an optional word,
            
            the search engine runs two queries. One for "action video" and one for "action".
            
            Records that match all words are ranked higher.
            
            
            For a search query with 4 or more words **and** all its words are optional,
            
            the number of matched words required for a record to be included in the search results increases for every 1,000 records:
            
            
            - If `optionalWords` has less than 10 words, the required number of matched words increases by 1:
              results 1 to 1,000 require 1 matched word, results 1,001 to 2000 need 2 matched words.
            - If `optionalWords` has 10 or more words, the number of required matched words increases by the number of optional words dividied by 5 (rounded down).
              For example, with 18 optional words: results 1 to 1,000 require 1 matched word, results 1,001 to 2000 need 4 matched words.
            
            For more information, see [Optional words](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/empty-or-insufficient-results/#creating-a-list-of-optional-words).

            Attribute names are case-sensitive.
            
            
            This can be useful for attributes with long values, where the likelyhood of an exact match is high,
            
            such as product descriptions.
            
            Turning off the Exact ranking criterion for these attributes favors exact matching on other attributes.
            
            This reduces the impact of individual attributes with a lot of content on ranking.

            - `exactPhrase`.
              Phrases in quotes must match exactly.

            - `excludeWords`.
              Query words prefixed with a `-` must not occur in a record.
              For example, `search -engine` matches records that contain "search" but not "engine".

            By default, the original words are highlighted even if a synonym matches.
            
            For example, with `home` as a synonym for `house` and a search for `home`,
            
            records matching either "home" or "house" are included in the search results,
            
            and either "home" or "house" are highlighted.
            
            
            With `replaceSynonymsInHighlight` set to `true`, a search for `home` still matches the same records,
            
            but all occurences of "house" are replaced by "home" in the highlighted response.

                Whether the `nbHits` is exhaustive (`true`) or approximate (`false`). When the query takes more than 50ms to be processed, the engine makes an approximation. This can happen when using complex filters on millions of records, when typo-tolerance was not exhaustive, or when enough hits have been retrieved (for example, after the engine finds 10,000 exact matches). `nbHits` is reported as non-exhaustive whenever an approximation is made, even if the approximation didn’t, in the end, impact the exhaustivity of the query.

An approximation is done when the typo search query part takes more than 10% of the query budget (ie. 5ms by default) to be processed (this can happen when a lot of typo alternatives exist for the query). This field will not be included when typo-tolerance is entirely disabled.

            Attributes used for [faceting](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/faceting/).
            
            
            Facets are attributes that let you categorize search results.
            
            They can be used for filtering search results.
            
            By default, no attribute is used for faceting.
            
            Attribute names are case-sensitive.
            
            
            **Modifiers**
            
            
            - `filterOnly("ATTRIBUTE")`.
              Allows using this attribute as a filter, but doesn't evalue the facet values.
            
            - `searchable("ATTRIBUTE")`.
              Allows searching for facet values.
            
            - `afterDistinct("ATTRIBUTE")`.
              Evaluates the facet count _after_ deduplication with `distinct`.
              This ensures accurate facet counts.
              You can apply this modifier to searchable facets: `afterDistinct(searchable(ATTRIBUTE))`.

            Replicas are copies of a primary index with the same records but different settings, synonyms, or rules.
            
            If you want to offer a different ranking or sorting of your search results, you'll use replica indices.
            
            All index operations on a primary index are automatically forwarded to its replicas.
            
            To add a replica index, you must provide the complete set of replicas to this parameter.
            
            If you omit a replica from this list, the replica turns into a regular, standalone index that will no longer by synced with the primary index.
            
            
            **Modifier**
            
            
            - `virtual("REPLICA")`.
              Create a virtual replica,
              Virtual replicas don't increase the number of records and are optimized for [Relevant sorting](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/sorting/in-depth/relevant-sort/).

            Attribute names are case-sensitive.
            
            
            Compound words are formed by combining two or more individual words,
            
            and are particularly prevalent in Germanic languages—for example, "firefighter".
            
            With decompounding, the individual components are indexed separately.
            
            
            You can specify different lists for different languages.
            
            Decompounding is supported for these languages:
            
            Dutch (`nl`), German (`de`), Finnish (`fi`), Danish (`da`), Swedish (`sv`), and Norwegian (`no`).

            **You should always specify an indexing language.**

            or the languages you specified with the `ignorePlurals` or `removeStopWords` parameters.

            By default, all numeric attributes are available as numerical filters.
            
            For faster indexing, reduce the number of numeric attributes.
            
            
            If you want to turn off filtering for all numeric attributes, specifiy an attribute that doesn't exist in your index, such as `NO_NUMERIC_FILTERING`.

            With `separatorsToIndex`, Algolia treats separator characters as separate words.

            Attributes used for searching. Attribute names are case-sensitive.
            
            
            By default, all attributes are searchable and the [Attribute](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/relevance-overview/in-depth/ranking-criteria/#attribute) ranking criterion is turned off.
            
            With a non-empty list, Algolia only returns results with matches in the selected attributes.
            
            In addition, the Attribute ranking criterion is turned on: matches in attributes that are higher in the list of `searchableAttributes` rank first.
            
            To make matches in two attributes rank equally, include them in a comma-separated string, such as `"title,alternate_title"`.
            
            Attributes with the same priority are always unordered.
            
            
            For more information, see [Searchable attributes](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/how-to/setting-searchable-attributes/).
            
            
            **Modifier**
            
            
            - `unordered("ATTRIBUTE")`.
              Ignore the position of a match within the attribute.
            
            Without modifier, matches at the beginning of an attribute rank higer than matches at the end.

        attributeForDistinct:
          description: >
            Attribute that should be used to establish groups of results.
            
            Attribute names are case-sensitive.
            
            
            All records with the same value for this attribute are considered a group.
            
            You can combine `attributeForDistinct` with the `distinct` search parameter to control
            
            how many items per group are included in the search results.
            
            
            If you want to use the same attribute also for faceting, use the `afterDistinct` modifier of the `attributesForFaceting` setting.
            
            This applies faceting _after_ deduplication, which will result in accurate facet counts.

            You can use leading and trailing wildcard characters (`*`):
            
            
            - `dev_*` matches all indices starting with "dev_".

            You can only add a single source, but you can provide a range of IP addresses.
            
            Use this to protect against API key leaking and reuse.
