  title: Recommend API
  description: >
    The Recommend API lets you retrieve recommendations from one of Algolia's AI recommendation models that you previously trained on your data.
    
    
    ## Client libraries
    
    
    Use Algolia's API clients and libraries to reliably integrate Algolia's APIs with your apps.
    
    The official API clients are covered by Algolia's [Service Level Agreement](https://www.algolia.com/policies/sla/).
    
    
    See: [Algolia's ecosystem](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/ecosystem/)
    
    
    ## Base URLs
    
    
    The base URLs for requests to the Recommend API are:
    
    
    - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}.algolia.net`
    
    - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-dsn.algolia.net`.
      If your subscription includes a [Distributed Search Network](https://dashboard.algolia.com/infra),
      this ensures that requests are sent to servers closest to users.
    
    Both URLs provide high availability by distributing requests with load balancing.
    
    
    **All requests must use HTTPS.**
    
    
    ## Retry strategy
    
    
    To guarantee a high availability, implement a retry strategy for all API requests using the URLs of your servers as fallbacks:
    
    
    - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-1.algolianet.com`
    
    - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-2.algolianet.com`
    
    - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-3.algolianet.com`
    
    
    These URLs use a different DNS provider than the primary URLs.
    
    You should randomize this list to ensure an even load across the three servers.
    
    
    All Algolia API clients implement this retry strategy.
    
    
    ## Authentication
    
    
    To authenticate your API requests, add these headers:
    
    
    - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application ID.
    
    - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the necessary permissions to make the request.
      The required access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in each endpoint's reference.
    
    You can find your application ID and API key in the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account).
    
    
    ## Request format
    
    
    Request bodies must be JSON objects.
    
    
    ## Response status and errors
    
    
    The Recommend API returns JSON responses.
    
    Since JSON doesn't guarantee any specific ordering, don't rely on the order of attributes in the API response.
    
    
    Successful responses return a `2xx` status. Client errors return a `4xx` status. Server errors are indicated by a `5xx` status.
    
    Error responses have a `message` property with more information.
    
    
    ## Version
    
    
    The current version of the Recommend API is version 1, as indicated by the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.

    filters:
      type: string
      description: >
        Filter expression to only include items that match the filter criteria in the response.
        
        
        You can use these filter expressions:
        
        
        - **Numeric filters.** `<facet> <op> <number>`, where `<op>` is one of `<`, `<=`, `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`.
        
        - **Ranges.** `<facet>:<lower> TO <upper>` where `<lower>` and `<upper>` are the lower and upper limits of the range (inclusive).
        
        - **Facet filters.** `<facet>:<value>` where `<facet>` is a facet attribute (case-sensitive) and `<value>` a facet value.
        
        - **Tag filters.** `_tags:<value>` or just `<value>` (case-sensitive).
        
        - **Boolean filters.** `<facet>: true | false`.
        
        
        You can combine filters with `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators with the following restrictions:
        
        
        - You can only combine filters of the same type with `OR`.
          **Not supported:** `facet:value OR num > 3`.
        - You can't use `NOT` with combinations of filters.
          **Not supported:** `NOT(facet:value OR facet:value)`
        - You can't combine conjunctions (`AND`) with `OR`.
          **Not supported:** `facet:value OR (facet:value AND facet:value)`
        
        Use quotes around your filters, if the facet attribute name or facet value has spaces, keywords (`OR`, `AND`, `NOT`), or quotes.
        
        If a facet attribute is an array, the filter matches if it matches at least one element of the array.
        
        
        For more information, see [Filters](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/filtering/).

      example: (category:Book OR category:Ebook) AND _tags:published

        - Filtering
    facetFilters:
      description: >
        Filter the search by facet values, so that only records with the same facet values are retrieved.
        
        
        **Prefer using the `filters` parameter, which supports all filter types and combinations with boolean operators.**
        
        
        - `[filter1, filter2]` is interpreted as `filter1 AND filter2`.
        
        - `[[filter1, filter2], filter3]` is interpreted as `filter1 OR filter2 AND filter3`.
        
        - `facet:-value` is interpreted as `NOT facet:value`.
        
        
        While it's best to avoid attributes that start with a `-`, you can still filter them by escaping with a backslash:
        
        `facet:\-value`.

    optionalFilters:
      description: >
        Filters to promote or demote records in the search results.
        
        
        Optional filters work like facet filters, but they don't exclude records from the search results.
        
        Records that match the optional filter rank before records that don't match.
        
        If you're using a negative filter `facet:-value`, matching records rank after records that don't match.
        
        
        - Optional filters don't work on virtual replicas.
        
        - Optional filters are applied _after_ sort-by attributes.
        
        - Optional filters don't work with numeric attributes.

      example:
        - category:Book
        - author:John Doe
      oneOf:
        - type: array

        - Filtering
    numericFilters:
      description: >
        Filter by numeric facets.
        
        
        **Prefer using the `filters` parameter, which supports all filter types and combinations with boolean operators.**
        
        
        You can use numeric comparison operators: `<`, `<=`, `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`. Comparsions are precise up to 3 decimals.
        
        You can also provide ranges: `facet:<lower> TO <upper>`. The range includes the lower and upper boundaries.
        
        The same combination rules apply as for `facetFilters`.

      example:
        - - inStock = 1
          - deliveryDate < 1441755506
        - price < 1000

    tagFilters:
      description: >
        Filter the search by values of the special `_tags` attribute.
        
        
        **Prefer using the `filters` parameter, which supports all filter types and combinations with boolean operators.**
        
        
        Different from regular facets, `_tags` can only be used for filtering (including or excluding records).
        
        You won't get a facet count.
        
        The same combination and escaping rules apply as for `facetFilters`.

      example:
        - - Book
          - Movie
        - SciFi

        Only records included within circle around this central location are included in the results.
        
        The radius of the circle is determined by the `aroundRadius` and `minimumAroundRadius` settings.
        
        This parameter is ignored if you also specify `insidePolygon` or `insideBoundingBox`.

    aroundRadius:
      description: >

        This parameter works in combination with the `aroundLatLng` and `aroundLatLngViaIP` parameters.
        
        By default, the search radius is determined automatically from the density of hits around the central location.
        
        The search radius is small if there are many hits close to the central coordinates.

            - `words` is set as the first ranking criterion.
            
            - All remaining words are treated as `optionalWords`.
            
            
            Since the `similarQuery` is supposed to do a broad search, they usually return many results.

            Determines the order in which Algolia returns your results.
            
            
            By default, each entry corresponds to a [ranking criteria](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/relevance-overview/in-depth/ranking-criteria/).
            
            The tie-breaking algorithm sequentially applies each criterion in the order they're specified.
            
            If you configure a replica index for [sorting by an attribute](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/sorting/how-to/sort-by-attribute/),
            
            you put the sorting attribute at the top of the list.

            - `desc("ATTRIBUTE")`.
              Sort the index by the values of an attribute, in descending order.
            
            Before you modify the default setting,
            
            you should test your changes in the dashboard,

            The custom ranking attributes decide which items are shown first if the other ranking criteria are equal.
            
            
            Records with missing values for your selected custom ranking attributes are always sorted last.

            This setting sets a default list of languages used by the `removeStopWords` and `ignorePlurals` settings.

            To support this, you must place the CJK language **first**.
            
            
            **You should always specify a query language.**
            
            If you don't specify an indexing language, the search engine uses all [supported languages](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/handling-natural-languages-nlp/in-depth/supported-languages/),
            
            or the languages you specified with the `ignorePlurals` or `removeStopWords` parameters.

            By default, records must match all words in the search query to be included in the search results.
            
            Adding optional words can help to increase the number of search results by running an additional search query that doesn't include the optional words.
            
            For example, if the search query is "action video" and "video" is an optional word,
            
            the search engine runs two queries. One for "action video" and one for "action".
            
            Records that match all words are ranked higher.
            
            
            For a search query with 4 or more words **and** all its words are optional,
            
            the number of matched words required for a record to be included in the search results increases for every 1,000 records:
            
            
            - If `optionalWords` has less than 10 words, the required number of matched words increases by 1:
              results 1 to 1,000 require 1 matched word, results 1,001 to 2000 need 2 matched words.
            - If `optionalWords` has 10 or more words, the number of required matched words increases by the number of optional words dividied by 5 (rounded down).
              For example, with 18 optional words: results 1 to 1,000 require 1 matched word, results 1,001 to 2000 need 4 matched words.

            Attribute names are case-sensitive.
            
            
            This can be useful for attributes with long values, where the likelyhood of an exact match is high,
            
            such as product descriptions.
            
            Turning off the Exact ranking criterion for these attributes favors exact matching on other attributes.
            
            This reduces the impact of individual attributes with a lot of content on ranking.

              Plurals and similar declensions added by the `ignorePlurals` setting are considered exact matches.
            
            - `singleWordSynonym`.
              Single-word synonyms, such as "NY/NYC" are considered exact matches.
            
            - `multiWordsSynonym`.
              Multi-word synonyms, such as "NY/New York" are considered exact matches.

            - `exactPhrase`.
              Phrases in quotes must match exactly.
              For example, `sparkly blue "iPhone case"` only returns records with the exact string "iPhone case".

            - `excludeWords`.
              Query words prefixed with a `-` must not occur in a record.
              For example, `search -engine` matches records that contain "search" but not "engine".

            By default, the original words are highlighted even if a synonym matches.
            
            For example, with `home` as a synonym for `house` and a search for `home`,
            
            records matching either "home" or "house" are included in the search results,

            With `replaceSynonymsInHighlight` set to `true`, a search for `home` still matches the same records,

                Whether the `nbHits` is exhaustive (`true`) or approximate (`false`). When the query takes more than 50ms to be processed, the engine makes an approximation. This can happen when using complex filters on millions of records, when typo-tolerance was not exhaustive, or when enough hits have been retrieved (for example, after the engine finds 10,000 exact matches). `nbHits` is reported as non-exhaustive whenever an approximation is made, even if the approximation didn’t, in the end, impact the exhaustivity of the query.
