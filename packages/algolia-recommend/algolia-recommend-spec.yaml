  title: Recommend API
  description: >
    The Recommend API lets you retrieve recommendations from one of Algolia's AI recommendation models that you previously trained on your data.
    
    
    ## Client libraries
    
    
    Use Algolia's API clients and libraries to reliably integrate Algolia's APIs with your apps.
    
    The official API clients are covered by Algolia's [Service Level Agreement](https://www.algolia.com/policies/sla/).
    
    
    See: [Algolia's ecosystem](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/ecosystem/)
    
    
    ## Base URLs
    
    
    The base URLs for requests to the Recommend API are:
    
    
    - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}.algolia.net`
    
    - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-dsn.algolia.net`.
      If your subscription includes a [Distributed Search Network](https://dashboard.algolia.com/infra),
      this ensures that requests are sent to servers closest to users.
    
    Both URLs provide high availability by distributing requests with load balancing.
    
    
    **All requests must use HTTPS.**
    
    
    ## Retry strategy
    
    
    To guarantee a high availability, implement a retry strategy for all API requests using the URLs of your servers as fallbacks:
    
    
    - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-1.algolianet.com`
    
    - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-2.algolianet.com`
    
    - `https://{APPLICATION_ID}-3.algolianet.com`
    
    
    These URLs use a different DNS provider than the primary URLs.
    
    You should randomize this list to ensure an even load across the three servers.
    
    
    All Algolia API clients implement this retry strategy.
    
    
    ## Authentication
    
    
    To authenticate your API requests, add these headers:
    
    
    - `x-algolia-application-id`. Your Algolia application ID.
    
    - `x-algolia-api-key`. An API key with the necessary permissions to make the request.
      The required access control list (ACL) to make a request is listed in each endpoint's reference.
    
    You can find your application ID and API key in the [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account).
    
    
    ## Request format
    
    
    Request bodies must be JSON objects.
    
    
    ## Response status and errors
    
    
    The Recommend API returns JSON responses.
    
    Since JSON doesn't guarantee any specific ordering, don't rely on the order of attributes in the API response.
    
    
    Successful responses return a `2xx` status. Client errors return a `4xx` status. Server errors are indicated by a `5xx` status.
    
    Error responses have a `message` property with more information.
    
    
    ## Version
    
    
    The current version of the Recommend API is version 1, as indicated by the `/1/` in each endpoint's URL.

      type: string
      description: >
        Keywords to be used instead of the search query to conduct a more broader search.
        
        
        Using the `similarQuery` parameter changes other settings:
        
        
        - `queryType` is set to `prefixNone`.
        
        - `removeStopWords` is set to true.
        
        - `words` is set as the first ranking criterion.
        
        - All remaining words are treated as `optionalWords`.
        
        
        Since the `similarQuery` is supposed to do a broad search, they usually return many results.
        
        Combine it with `filters` to narrow down the list of results.

    filters:
      type: string
      description: >
        Filter expression to only include items that match the filter criteria in the response.
        
        
        You can use these filter expressions:
        
        
        - **Numeric filters.** `<facet> <op> <number>`, where `<op>` is one of `<`, `<=`, `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`.
        
        - **Ranges.** `<facet>:<lower> TO <upper>` where `<lower>` and `<upper>` are the lower and upper limits of the range (inclusive).
        
        - **Facet filters.** `<facet>:<value>` where `<facet>` is a facet attribute (case-sensitive) and `<value>` a facet value.
        
        - **Tag filters.** `_tags:<value>` or just `<value>` (case-sensitive).
        
        - **Boolean filters.** `<facet>: true | false`.
        
        
        You can combine filters with `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators with the following restrictions:
        
        
        - You can only combine filters of the same type with `OR`.
          **Not supported:** `facet:value OR num > 3`.
        - You can't use `NOT` with combinations of filters.
          **Not supported:** `NOT(facet:value OR facet:value)`
        - You can't combine conjunctions (`AND`) with `OR`.
          **Not supported:** `facet:value OR (facet:value AND facet:value)`
        
        Use quotes around your filters, if the facet attribute name or facet value has spaces, keywords (`OR`, `AND`, `NOT`), or quotes.
        
        If a facet attribute is an array, the filter matches if it matches at least one element of the array.
        
        
        For more information, see [Filters](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/filtering/).

      x-categories:
        - Filtering
    facetFilters:
      description: >
        Filter the search by facet values, so that only records with the same facet values are retrieved.
        
        
        **Prefer using the `filters` parameter, which supports all filter types and combinations with boolean operators.**
        
        
        - `[filter1, filter2]` is interpreted as `filter1 AND filter2`.
        
        - `[[filter1, filter2], filter3]` is interpreted as `filter1 OR filter2 AND filter3`.
        
        - `facet:-value` is interpreted as `NOT facet:value`.
        
        
        While it's best to avoid attributes that start with a `-`, you can still filter them by escaping with a backslash:
        
        `facet:\-value`.

    optionalFilters:
      description: >
        Filters to promote or demote records in the search results.
        
        
        Optional filters work like facet filters, but they don't exclude records from the search results.
        
        Records that match the optional filter rank before records that don't match.
        
        If you're using a negative filter `facet:-value`, matching records rank after records that don't match.
        
        
        - Optional filters don't work on virtual replicas.
        
        - Optional filters are applied _after_ sort-by attributes.
        
        - Optional filters are applied _before_ custom ranking attributes (in the default [ranking](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/relevance-overview/in-depth/ranking-criteria/)).
        
        - Optional filters don't work with numeric attributes.


      example:
        - category:Book
        - author:John Doe
      oneOf:
        - type: array
          items:

        - Filtering
    numericFilters:
      description: >
        Filter by numeric facets.
        
        
        **Prefer using the `filters` parameter, which supports all filter types and combinations with boolean operators.**
        
        
        You can use numeric comparison operators: `<`, `<=`, `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`.
        
        Comparisons are precise up to 3 decimals.
        
        You can also provide ranges: `facet:<lower> TO <upper>`. The range includes the lower and upper boundaries.
        
        The same combination rules apply as for `facetFilters`.


      example:
        - - inStock = 1
          - deliveryDate < 1441755506
        - price < 1000

    tagFilters:
      description: >
        Filter the search by values of the special `_tags` attribute.
        
        
        **Prefer using the `filters` parameter, which supports all filter types and combinations with boolean operators.**
        
        
        Different from regular facets, `_tags` can only be used for filtering (including or excluding records).
        
        You won't get a facet count.
        
        The same combination and escaping rules apply as for `facetFilters`.


      example:
        - - Book
          - Movie
        - SciFi
      oneOf:

        If true, all filter scores are summed.
        
        Otherwise, the maximum filter score is kept.

        To retrieve all facets, use the wildcard character `*`.
        
        For more information, see [facets](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/faceting/#contextual-facet-values-and-counts).

        This leads to accurate facet counts when using faceting in combination with `distinct`.
        
        It's usually better to use `afterDistinct` modifiers in the `attributesForFaceting` setting,
        
        as `facetingAfterDistinct` only computes correct facet counts if all records have the same facet values for the `attributeForDistinct`.

        Only records included within a circle around this central location are included in the results.
        
        The radius of the circle is determined by the `aroundRadius` and `minimumAroundRadius` settings.
        
        This parameter is ignored if you also specify `insidePolygon` or `insideBoundingBox`.

        This parameter works in combination with the `aroundLatLng` and `aroundLatLngViaIP` parameters.
        
        By default, the search radius is determined automatically from the density of hits around the central location.
        
        The search radius is small if there are many hits close to the central coordinates.

        Coordinates of a polygon in which to search.
        
        
        Polygons are defined by 3 to 10,000 points. Each point is represented by its latitude and longitude.
        
        Provide multiple polygons as nested arrays.
        
        For more information, see [filtering inside polygons](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/geolocation/#filtering-inside-rectangular-or-polygonal-areas).
        
        This parameter is ignored if you also specify `insideBoundingBox`.

            Facets are attributes that let you categorize search results.
            
            They can be used for filtering search results.
            
            By default, no attribute is used for faceting.
            
            Attribute names are case-sensitive.
            
            
            **Modifiers**
            
            
            - `filterOnly("ATTRIBUTE")`.
              Allows the attribute to be used as a filter but doesn't evaluate the facet values.
            
            - `searchable("ATTRIBUTE")`.
              Allows searching for facet values.
            
            - `afterDistinct("ATTRIBUTE")`.
              Evaluates the facet count _after_ deduplication with `distinct`.
              This ensures accurate facet counts.
              You can apply this modifier to searchable facets: `afterDistinct(searchable(ATTRIBUTE))`.

            Replicas are copies of a primary index with the same records but different settings, synonyms, or rules.
            
            If you want to offer a different ranking or sorting of your search results, you'll use replica indices.
            
            All index operations on a primary index are automatically forwarded to its replicas.
            
            To add a replica index, you must provide the complete set of replicas to this parameter.
            
            If you omit a replica from this list, the replica turns into a regular, standalone index that will no longer be synced with the primary index.
            
            
            **Modifier**
            
            
            - `virtual("REPLICA")`.
              Create a virtual replica,
              Virtual replicas don't increase the number of records and are optimized for [Relevant sorting](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/sorting/in-depth/relevant-sort/).

            Attribute names are case-sensitive.
            
            
            Compound words are formed by combining two or more individual words,
            
            and are particularly prevalent in Germanic languages—for example, "firefighter".
            
            With decompounding, the individual components are indexed separately.
            
            
            You can specify different lists for different languages.
            
            Decompounding is supported for these languages:
            
            Dutch (`nl`), German (`de`), Finnish (`fi`), Danish (`da`), Swedish (`sv`), and Norwegian (`no`).
            
            Decompounding doesn't work for words with [non-spacing mark Unicode characters](https://www.charactercodes.net/category/non-spacing_mark).
            
            For example, `Gartenstühle` won't be decompounded if the `ü` consists of `u` (U+0075) and `◌̈` (U+0308).

            Attribute names are case-sensitive.
            
            
            By default, all numeric attributes are available as numerical filters.
            
            For faster indexing, reduce the number of numeric attributes.
            
            
            To turn off filtering for all numeric attributes, specify an attribute that doesn't exist in your index, such as `NO_NUMERIC_FILTERING`.
            
            
            **Modifier**
            
            
            - `equalOnly("ATTRIBUTE")`.
              Support only filtering based on equality comparisons `=` and `!=`.

            Control which non-alphanumeric characters are indexed.
            
            
            By default, Algolia ignores [non-alphanumeric characters](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/typo-tolerance/how-to/how-to-search-in-hyphenated-attributes/#handling-non-alphanumeric-characters) like hyphen (`-`), plus (`+`), and parentheses (`(`,`)`).
            
            To include such characters, define them with `separatorsToIndex`.
            
            
            Separators are all non-letter characters except spaces and currency characters, such as $€£¥.
            
            
            With `separatorsToIndex`, Algolia treats separator characters as separate words.
            
            For example, in a search for "Disney+", Algolia considers "Disney" and "+" as two separate words.

            Attributes used for searching. Attribute names are case-sensitive.
            
            
            By default, all attributes are searchable and the [Attribute](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/relevance-overview/in-depth/ranking-criteria/#attribute) ranking criterion is turned off.
            
            With a non-empty list, Algolia only returns results with matches in the selected attributes.
            
            In addition, the Attribute ranking criterion is turned on: matches in attributes that are higher in the list of `searchableAttributes` rank first.
            
            To make matches in two attributes rank equally, include them in a comma-separated string, such as `"title,alternate_title"`.
            
            Attributes with the same priority are always unordered.
            
            
            For more information, see [Searchable attributes](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/how-to/setting-searchable-attributes/).

              Ignore the position of a match within the attribute.
            
            Without a modifier, matches at the beginning of an attribute rank higher than matches at the end.

            All records with the same value for this attribute are considered a group.
            
            You can combine `attributeForDistinct` with the `distinct` search parameter to control
            
            how many items per group are included in the search results.
            
            
            If you want to use the same attribute also for faceting, use the `afterDistinct` modifier of the `attributesForFaceting` setting.
            
            This applies faceting _after_ deduplication, which will result in accurate facet counts.

            By default, Algolia removes diacritics from letters.
            For example, `é` becomes `e`. If this causes issues in your search,
            you can specify characters that should keep their diacritics.

        Word segmentation is supported for these languages: German, Dutch, Finnish, Swedish, and Norwegian.
        
        Decompounding doesn't work for words with [non-spacing mark Unicode characters](https://www.charactercodes.net/category/non-spacing_mark).
        
        For example, `Gartenstühle` won't be decompounded if the `ü` consists of `u` (U+0075) and `◌̈` (U+0308).

      description: >
        Words that should be considered optional when found in the query.
        
        
        By default, records must match all words in the search query to be included in the search results.
        
        Adding optional words can help to increase the number of search results by running an additional search query that doesn't include the optional words.
        
        For example, if the search query is "action video" and "video" is an optional word,
        
        the search engine runs two queries. One for "action video" and one for "action".
        
        Records that match all words are ranked higher.
        
        
        For a search query with 4 or more words **and** all its words are optional,
        
        the number of matched words required for a record to be included in the search results increases for every 1,000 records:
        
        
        - If `optionalWords` has less than 10 words, the required number of matched words increases by 1:
          results 1 to 1,000 require 1 matched word, results 1,001 to 2000 need 2 matched words.
        - If `optionalWords` has 10 or more words, the number of required matched words increases by the number of optional words divided by 5 (rounded down).
          For example, with 18 optional words: results 1 to 1,000 require 1 matched word, results 1,001 to 2000 need 4 matched words.

        Attribute names are case-sensitive.
        
        
        This can be useful for attributes with long values, where the likelihood of an exact match is high,
        
        such as product descriptions.
        
        Turning off the Exact ranking criterion for these attributes favors exact matching on other attributes.
        
        This reduces the impact of individual attributes with a lot of content on ranking.

          The Exact ranking criterion is 1 if the query word and attribute value are the same.

        Determine which plurals and synonyms should be considered an exact matches.
        
        
        By default, Algolia treats singular and plural forms of a word, and single-word synonyms, as [exact](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/relevance-overview/in-depth/ranking-criteria/#exact) matches when searching.
        
        For example:
        
        
        - "swimsuit" and "swimsuits" are treated the same
        
        - "swimsuit" and "swimwear" are treated the same (if they are [synonyms](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/adding-synonyms/#regular-synonyms)).
        
        
        - `ignorePlurals`.
          Plurals and similar declensions added by the `ignorePlurals` setting are considered exact matches.
        
        - `singleWordSynonym`.
          Single-word synonyms, such as "NY" = "NYC", are considered exact matches.
        
        - `multiWordsSynonym`.
          Multi-word synonyms, such as "NY" = "New York", are considered exact matches.

        - `excludeWords`.
          Query words prefixed with a `-` must not occur in a record.

        Records with the same value for the `attributeForDistinct` attribute are considered a group.
        
        The `distinct` setting controls how many members of the group are returned.
        
        This is useful for [deduplication and grouping](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/grouping/#introducing-algolias-distinct-feature).

              The number of hits won't be correct and faceting won't work as expected.
            - With `distinct > 1`, the `hitsPerPage` parameter controls the number of returned groups.
              For example, with `hitsPerPage: 10` and `distinct: 2`, up to 20 records are returned.
              Likewise, the `nbHits` response attribute contains the number of returned groups.

        For example, with `home` as a synonym for `house` and a search for `home`,
        
        records matching either "home" or "house" are included in the search results,
        
        and either "home" or "house" are highlighted.
        
        
        With `replaceSynonymsInHighlight` set to `true`, a search for `home` still matches the same records,
        
        but all occurrences of "house" are replaced by "home" in the highlighted response.
