# Magento Payment Afterpay

Integrates GraphCommerce with the Magento Afterpay module.

It requires [Afterpay](https://github.com/afterpay/afterpay-magento-2) module to
be installed before using this package.

## Installation

1. Find current version of your `@graphcommerce/magento-cart-payment-method` in
   your package.json.
2. `yarn add @graphcommerce/magento-payment-afterpay@1.2.3` (replace 1.2.3 with
   the version of the step above)

This package uses GraphCommerce plugin systems, so there is no code modification
required.
