# Getting started with GraphCommerce

In this guide, you will set up a GraphCommerce app locally, allowing you to
start building.

### Preparations

- MacOS, Windows with WSL2 or Linux
- Install and use node 20: `nvm install 20` or `nvm use 20`
- Install yarn: `corepack enable`

## Step 1: Create a GraphCommerce app

```bash
git clone -b main --depth 1 https://github.com/graphcommerce-org/graphcommerce.git
# Clone repository
```

```bash
mkdir my-project
# Create project folder
```

There are a few starting points to choose from with or without Hygraph:

Option 1: Only Magento Open Source:

```bash
cp -R graphcommerce/examples/magento-magento-open-source/. my-project && cd my-project
```

Option 2: Magento Open Source + Hygraph:

```bash
cp -R graphcommerce/examples/magento-graphcms/. my-project && cd my-project
```

Option 3: Adobe Commerce:

Please contact us for more information to get access to the Adobe Commerce
starting point.

## Step 2: Configure API keys (optional)

Duplicate and rename the configuration example file to:
`graphcommerce.config.js` and configure the following:

- `magentoEndpoint` [?](../framework/config.md#magentoendpoint-string-required)
- `hygraphEndpoint` [?](../framework/config.md#hygraphendpoint-string-required)
- `magentoStoreCode`
  [?](../framework/config.md#magentostorecode-string-required)

> magentoStoreCode
>
> - The first storeview in your object is loaded by default, with no added
>   suffix to the URL.
> - As the user switches to, e.g., the Canadian storeview, the suffix /en-ca is
>   added to the URL.
> - The locale, e.g., en-ca, is used to load the storeview
>   [translation](../framework/translations.md)
> - A user is auto-redirected to the relevant storeview when their browser
>   language matches the locale
>   (`Admin > Store > Configuration > General > General > Locale`) of that
>   storeview.

### Requirements

- Magento version 2.4.5 or higher - Clean install, a production or a development
  environment (technically 2.4.3 and 2.4.4 also work, but in practice important
  bugfixes have been made in the latest versions.)
- Hygraph - A project with the required schema.
  [Clone â†—](https://app.hygraph.com/clone/caddaa93cfa9436a9e76ae9c0f34d257?name=GraphCommerce%20Demo)
  the schema as your starwting point.

## Step 3: Start the app

```bash
touch yarn.lock && yarn
# Install dependencies (may take a while)
```

```bash
yarn codegen
# Converts all .graphql files to typescript files
```

```bash
yarn dev
# Run the app
```
