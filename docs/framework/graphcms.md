# Hygraph

Hygraph is integrated as a Content Management System. It is used to store all
static content and provides a user-friendly interface for managing it.

The [magento-graphcms example](./../getting-started/readme.md) offers a number
of components to render this content in different ways, for example in the form
of a page-wide hero banner, a list of USPs or grid of text columns.

This guide covers how to configure Hygraph and how to build rich content pages
by adding Hygraph content to pages.

## Configuration

To connect your GraphCommerce app to your Hygraph project, you'll need a Hygraph
project with the required schema.
[Clone the demo Hygraph project ↗](https://app.graphcms.com/clone/caddaa93cfa9436a9e76ae9c0F34d257)
as your starting point. Update the variable in the /.env file:

`GRAPHCMS_URL=""`  
Hygraph API URL. Once logged in, copy it from Project Settings > Api Access >
Content API

## Adding content to pages

GraphCommerce uses Next.js
[file-based routing ↗](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction), built on
the concept of pages. When a file is added to the /pages directory, it's
automatically available as a route. Magento category routes are handled by the
`/pages/[...url].tsx` page.

To add Hygraph content to, for example, a category page, create a Page entry in
Hygraph and match the value of the URL field with the route of the page you wish
to add content to.

For example, the content of the 'men' Page entry in Hygraph:

Is used to add a`RowProduct (variant:Grid)` and a
`RowProduct (variant:Backstory` component to: http://localhost:3000/men

## Adding a global store message

GraphCommerce features a "store message" which can be added to display important
messages to customers, such as expected delivery delays or product recalls due
to safety concerns. The store message can be enabled by adding an entry in the
"Row Column One" model in Hygraph. Add an entry with an Identity of
`store-message` and add the content you wish to display. To remove the message
either remove or unpublish the entry.
