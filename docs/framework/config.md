# GraphCommerce configuration system

Global GraphCommerce configuration can be configured in your `graphcommerce.config.js` file
in the root of your project and are automatically validated on startup.

## Configuring with the configuration file.

The configuration file is a javascript file that exports a `GraphCommerceConfig` object. See graphcommerce.config.js.example for an example.

## Using configuration

Configuration can be accessed in your project with the `import.meta.graphCommerce` object.

```tsx
import { storefrontAll, storefrontConfig, storefrontConfigDefault, useStorefrontConfig } from '@graphcommerce/next-ui'

// Accessing a global value
const globalConf = import.meta.graphCommerce.cartDisplayPricesInclTax

function MyComponent() {
  // Configuration configured per storefront locale.
  const scopedConfig = useStorefrontConfig().cartDisplayPricesInclTax

  // Creating a fallback system
  const scopedConfigWithFallback = scopedConfig ?? globalConf

  // Or as single line
  const scopedConfigWithFallback2 =
    useStorefrontConfig().cartDisplayPricesInclTax ?? import.meta.graphCommerce.cartDisplayPricesInclTax

  return <div>{googleRecaptchaKey}</div>
}
```

You can also use the configuration in your `.meshrc.yml` by accessing
`{graphCommerce.myField}`

```yml
endpoint: '{graphCommerce.magentoEndpoint}'
```

## Environment variables to override configuration

Configuration values can be overwriten by environment variables, with the following rules:
- Convert from camelCase to `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- Prefix with `GC_`
- Arrays can be indexed with `_0`, `_1`, `_2`, etc.
- Objects can be accessed with `_<key>`.

Examples:
- `limitSsg` -> `GC_LIMIT_SSG="1"`
- `storefront[0].locale` -> `GC_STOREFRONT_0_LOCALE="en"`
- `debug.pluginStatus` -> `GC_DEBUG_PLUGIN_STATUS="1"`


## Exporting current configuration to environment variables

You can export configuration by running `yarn graphcommerce export-config`

## Extending the configuration in your  project

Create a graphql/Config.graphqls file in your project and extend the GraphCommerceConfig, GraphCommerceStorefrontConfig inputs to add configuration.

```graphql
extend input GraphCommerceConfig {
  myConfig: String # or Boolean, or Int, or Float, make required with `!`
}
extend input GraphCommerceStorefrontConfig {
  myField: Boolean
}
```

## All configuration values

Below is a list of all possible configurations that can be set by GraphCommerce.

### GraphCommerceConfig

#### canonicalBaseUrl: string (required)

The canonical base URL is used for SEO purposes.

Examples:
- https://example.com
- https://example.com/en
- https://example.com/en-US

#### hygraphEndpoint: string (required)

The HyGraph endpoint.

> Read-only endpoint that allows low latency and high read-throughput content delivery.

Project settings -> API Access -> High Performance Read-only Content API

#### magentoEndpoint: string (required)

GraphQL Magento endpoint.

Examples:
- https://magento2.test/graphql

#### storefront: [GraphCommerceStorefrontConfig](#GraphCommerceStorefrontConfig)[] (required)

All storefront configuration for the project

#### cartDisplayPricesInclTax: boolean

Due to a limitation of the GraphQL API it is not possible to determine if a cart should be displayed including or excluding tax.

When Magento's StoreConfig adds this value, this can be replaced.

#### compare: boolean

Use compare functionality

#### compareVariant: 'CHECKBOX' | 'ICON' = 'ICON'

By default the compare feature is denoted with a 'compare ICON' (2 arrows facing one another).
This may be fine for experienced users, but for more clarity it's also possible to present the compare feature as a CHECKBOX accompanied by the 'Compare' label

#### configurableVariantForSimple: boolean = false

If a simple product is part of a Configurable product page, should the simple product be
rendered as a configured option of the configurable product page?

How does this work:

When the `products(filters: { url_key: { eq: 'simple-product' } }) { ... }` query is ran,
Magento also returns the Simple product and the Configurable product the simple belongs to.

If that is the case we render the configurable product page instead of the simple product page but
the options to select the simple product are pre-selected.

#### configurableVariantValues: [MagentoConfigurableVariantValues](#MagentoConfigurableVariantValues) = { content: true, url: true }

When a user selects a variant, it will switch the values on the configurable page with the values of the configured variant.

Enabling options here will allow switching of those variants.

#### crossSellsHideCartItems: boolean = false

Determines if cross sell items should be shown when the user already has the product in their cart. This will result in a product will popping off the screen when you add it to the cart.

Default: 'false'

#### crossSellsRedirectItems: boolean = false

Determines if, after adding a cross-sell item to the cart, the user should be redirected to the cross-sell items of the product they just added.

Default: 'false'

#### customerRequireEmailConfirmation: boolean

Due to a limitation in the GraphQL API of Magento 2, we need to know if the
customer requires email confirmation.

This value should match Magento 2's configuration value for
`customer/create_account/confirm` and should be removed once we can query

#### debug: [GraphCommerceDebugConfig](#GraphCommerceDebugConfig)

Debug configuration for GraphCommerce

#### demoMode: boolean = true

Enables some demo specific code that is probably not useful for a project:

- Adds the "BY GC" to the product list items.
- Adds "dominant_color" attribute swatches to the product list items.
- Creates a big list items in the product list.

#### enableGuestCheckoutLogin: boolean

During customer login, GraphCommerce queries Magento to determine whether

For Magento versions, 2.4.7, 2.4.6-p1 and up, 2.4.5-p3 and up, 2.4.4-p4 and up, the following setting must be set to Yes

`Stores -> Configuration -> Sales -> Checkout -> Checkout Options -> Enable Guest Checkout Login`

ReCAPTCHA can then be enabled/disabled for the different forms, separately (Stores > Configuration > Security > Google ReCAPTCHA Storefront > Storefront)
