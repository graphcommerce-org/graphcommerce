# GraphCommerce configuration system

Global GraphCommerce configuration can be configured in your `graphcommerce.config.js` file
in the root of your project and are automatically validated on startup.

## Configuring with the configuration file.

The configuration file is a javascript file that exports a `GraphCommerceConfig` object. See graphcommerce.config.js.example for an example.

## Using configuration

Configuration can be accessed in your project with the `import.meta.graphCommerce` object.

```tsx
import { storefrontAll, storefrontConfig, storefrontConfigDefault, useStorefrontConfig } from '@graphcommerce/next-ui'

// Accessing a global value
const globalConf = import.meta.graphCommerce.cartDisplayPricesInclTax

function MyComponent() {
  // Configuration configured per storefront locale.
  const scopedConfig = useStorefrontConfig().cartDisplayPricesInclTax

  // Creating a fallback system
  const scopedConfigWithFallback = scopedConfig ?? globalConf

  // Or as single line
  const scopedConfigWithFallback2 =
    useStorefrontConfig().cartDisplayPricesInclTax ?? import.meta.graphCommerce.cartDisplayPricesInclTax

  return <div>{googleRecaptchaKey}</div>
}
```

You can also use the configuration in your `.meshrc.yml` by accessing
`{graphCommerce.myField}`

```yml
endpoint: '{graphCommerce.magentoEndpoint}'
```

## Environment variables to override configuration

Configuration values can be overwriten by environment variables, with the following rules:
- Convert from camelCase to `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- Prefix with `GC_`
- Arrays can be indexed with `_0`, `_1`, `_2`, etc.
- Objects can be accessed with `_<key>`.

Examples:
- `limitSsg` -> `GC_LIMIT_SSG="1"`
- `storefront[0].locale` -> `GC_STOREFRONT_0_LOCALE="en"`
- `debug.pluginStatus` -> `GC_DEBUG_PLUGIN_STATUS="1"`


## Exporting current configuration to environment variables

You can export configuration by running `yarn graphcommerce export-config`

## Extending the configuration in your  project

Create a graphql/Config.graphqls file in your project and extend the GraphCommerceConfig, GraphCommerceStorefrontConfig inputs to add configuration.

```graphql
extend input GraphCommerceConfig {
  myConfig: String # or Boolean, or Int, or Float, make required with `!`
}
extend input GraphCommerceStorefrontConfig {
  myField: Boolean
}
```
