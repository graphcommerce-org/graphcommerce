# GraphCommerce framework overview

GraphCommerce is a front-end framework used for building headless Magento
e-commerce storefronts in React. It includes the structure, components, and
tooling you need to get started so you can spend your time styling and designing
high-end e-commerce progressive web apps (PWA).

### Framework concepts and components

## GraphCommerce project structure

When you create a GraphCommerce app, the GraphCommerce
[magento-graphcms example](../getting-started/readme.md) comes with a basic file
structure of a GraphCommerce project that's integrated with Magento and
GraphCMS. Most of the files that you'll work within your GraphCommerce project
are located in the /components or /pages directories.

- A minimal set of components you would most likely modify for your project
- The main layout component, which renders header, navigation, and footer
- A set of boilerplate pages, which handle URL routing
- Basic global styles in theme.ts provided by
  [Mui ↗](https://mui.com/customization/default-theme/)
- Interface translation files
