# Troubleshouting

## Common build errors

If any errors are detected during the build phase, the console and browser will
display an error message. Common causes for errors are:

```bash
[next] 🕸️ - m2: Failed to generate schema: request to [...] failed, reason: connect ETIMEDOUT
```

Missing MAGENTO_ENDPOINT environment variable in your .env file

```bash
🕸️ - m2: Failed to generate schema: invalid json response body at [...] reason: Unexpected '<'
```

MAGENTO_ENDPOINT environment variable is not pointing to a Magento graphql
endpoint

```bash
[next] error - Error: Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0
```

The Magento version is outdated. Make sure you are running Magento 2.4.3 and up

```bash
Error: Invalid src prop ([...]) on 'next/image', hostname "[...]" is not configured under images in your 'next.config.js'
```

Add the image domain to IMAGE_DOMAINS in your .env file

```bash
File /[...]/node_modules/@graphcommerce/magento-payment-braint
ree/hooks/UseBraintree.graphql caused error: Unable to find field "createBraintreeClientToken" on type "Mutation"!
```

Remove "@graphcommerce/magento-payment-braintree" from your dependencies in
package.json. Run `yarn` to update dependencies, then run `yarn dev`.

```bash
File /[...]/node_modules/@graphcommerce/mollie-magento-payment
/components/MolliePlaceOrder/MolliePlaceOrder.graphql caused error: Unable to
find field "mollie_redirect_url" on type "Order"!
```

Remove "@graphcommerce/mollie-magento-payment" from your dependencies in
package.json. Run `yarn` to update dependencies, then run `yarn dev`.

```bash
node_modules/@graphcommerce/graphql/generated/fragments.json
Error: Interface field RoutableInterface.type expects type UrlRewriteEntityTypeEnum but BundleProduct.type is type String.
```

In the Magento store, a product attribute is configured with attribute_code
'type'. Migrate the product information to a new attribute and remove the
