## Development setup

This Development Setup guide is to develop the GraphCommerce project it's self.
If you are looking to use GraphCommerce for your own project, take a look at the
[Getting Stared guide](./development-setup.md)

## Installation

- Make sure you have installed yarn: `npm install --global yarn`

1. `git@github.com:ho-nl/m2-pwa.git graphcommerce && cd graphcommerce`
