# Contributing to GraphCommerce

Looking to contribute something to GraphCommerce? Here's how you can help.

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved.

### Bug reports

Well-written, through bug reports are a great way to contribute to the project.
Before raising a new issue, please check our
[issues list ↗](https://github.com/graphcommerce-org/graphcommerce/issues) to
determine whether the issue you encountered has already been reported.

A good bug report should be self-explanatory. Use the
[bug report template ↗](https://github.com/graphcommerce-org/graphcommerce/issues/new/choose)
to create a bug report.

### Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. Please take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong
case to convince us of the merits of this feature.

Provide as much detail and context as possible. Use the
[feature request template ↗](https://github.com/graphcommerce-org/graphcommerce/issues/new/choose)
to create a feature request.

## Pull requests

Good pull requests (e.g. patches, improvements, new features) are a fantastic
help. Please
[ask first ↗](https://join.slack.com/t/graphcommerce/shared_invite/zt-11rmgq1ad-F~0daNtKcSvtcC4eQRzjeQ)
before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features or
refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on
something that might not be relevant to the project.

### Creating a branch

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. Create a branch for your PR based on the `canary` branch. Use the following
   naming convention: `feature/your-branch-name` or `fix/your-branch-name`

### Creating a pull request

1. Create a pull request. The PR can stay open until you are ready to merge.
2. Add your changes
3. Add a changeset

- Run 'yarn changeset' and select 'patch' for bugfixes and 'minor' for new
  features. Commit the changeset that is created.

### Merge checklist for your pull request

- Code must pass the CI checks.
- Code must be formatted with prettier
- Changeset is available
- Eslint must not report any errors in the changed files
- Eslint should not give any warnings in the changed files
- Bundle size should not increase significantly
- Lingui translations must be
  [generated](https://www.graphcommerce.org/docs/framework/translations#generating-translation-files-with-all-translations)
  and translated
- Changes made to `examples/magento-graphcms` should be kept to a minimum,
  because every change made here must be applied by every developer upgrading a
  GraphCommerce project
  - Extract code changes made and move them into packages where possible.
  - Stylistic only changes usually aren't preferred, less changes often is
    better.
