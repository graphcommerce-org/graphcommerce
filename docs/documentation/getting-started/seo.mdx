## Sitemap and robots.txt

Sitemaps are automatically generated with every build using
[next-sitemap](https://github.com/iamvishnusankar/next-sitemap)

To manually generate a sitemap, use the following command:

`yarn next-sitemap`

As for URLs, the sitemap uses Vercel's `VERCEL_URL` environment variable for
development environments, and eventually falls back on `http://localhost:3000`.
On production, use `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` environment variable to set the
correct url.

Additional sitemap configuration can be done in `next-sitemap.js`. next-sitemap
automatically detects this configuration file.
