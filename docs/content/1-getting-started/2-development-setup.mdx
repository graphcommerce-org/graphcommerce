## Development setup

This Development Setup guide is to develop the GraphCommerce project itself. If
you are looking to use GraphCommerce for your own project, take a look at the
[Getting Started](./development-setup.md) guide.

## Installation

- Make sure you are using node 14: `nvm install 14 && nvm use 14`
- Make sure you have installed yarn: `npm install --global yarn`

1. `git clone git@github.com:ho-nl/m2-pwa.git graphcommerce && cd graphcommerce`
2. `yarn install`

To start an example, take a look at the README.me for that example.
