# Create a GraphCommerce storefront

You're ready to create a GraphCommerce storefront. You want to set up your
development environment so that you can begin development.

In this tutorial, you'll create a GraphCommerce app locally to begin developing
a full featured storefront. GraphCommerce is a front-end framework used for
building headless Magento e-commerce PWA's.

## What you'll learn

After you've finished this tutorial, you'll have accomplished the following:

- Set up your local development environment
- Generated a new project based on the magento-graphcms example

## Requirements

You've familiarized yourself with
[React ↗](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html),
[Next.js ↗](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started), and
[Mui ↗](https://mui.com/getting-started/installation/). GraphCommerce is a
frontend React framework that uses Next.js for server-side rendering.

## Install dependencies

If you want to test a GraphCommerce storefront using a pre-configured Magento
demo store and a pre-configured GraphCMS project with demo content, then you
need to only install the dependencies. This is the quickest approach.

- Install and use node 14: `nvm install 14 && nvm use 14`
- Install yarn: `npm install --global yarn`

If you are using an Apple M1 chip, for anything under nvm v15, you will need to install node using Rosetta 2.
You can do this by running the nvm installation commands inside the Rosetta 2 shell.

- Run shell under Rosetta 2: `arch -x86_64 zsh`
- Install yarn: `nvm install 14 && nvm use 14`

# Step 1: Create a new GraphCommerce app

### Download the example

- `git clone https://github.com/ho-nl/m2-pwa graphcommerce`
- `mkdir my-project`
- `cp -R graphcommerce/examples/magento-graphcms/. my-project`
- `cd my-project`
- `cp -R .env.example .env`
- `rm CHANGELOG.md && touch CHANGELOG.md`
- `rm -rf node_modules && rm -rf .next`

### Update package.json

Edit /package.json. Delete `"scripts": {...}` and rename `scripts_local` to
`scripts`:

```json
{
  "name": "@my-company/my-project",
  "scripts": {
    ...
  }
}
```

# Step 2: Magento and GraphCMS API keys

> By default, the .env file is configured with API keys from a demo Magento
> store and a demo GraphCMS project. If you want to test your GraphCommerce app
> using the demo store, then you can start the development environment. Only
> proceed with the following steps if you want to develop a GraphCommerce
> storefront using your own Magento store and/or GraphCMS project.

### Requirements

To order to be able to connect your GraphCommerce app to your Magento backend
and/or GraphCMS project, you'll need:

- Magento 2.4.3 - Clean install, or a production or development environment
- GraphCMS - A GraphCMS project with the required schema.
  [Clone the demo GraphCMS project](https://app.graphcms.com/clone/caddaa93cfa9436a9e76ae9c0F34d257)
  as your starting point.

### Configuration

To connect your GraphCommerce app to your Magento backend and/or GraphCMS
project, you need to update variables in the /.env file. The .env file contains
useful information about your storefront.

`MAGENTO_ENDPOINT=""`  
Magento 2 API url, located at `http://<magento2-server>/graphql`.

`IMAGE_DOMAINS=",media.graphcms.com"`  
Comma separated list of image domains. Add media.graphcms.com as default.

`GRAPHCMS_URL=""`  
GraphCMS API url. Once logged in, copy it from Project Settings > Api Access >
Content API

`NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCALE_STORES='{"en": "en_US", "nl": "default"}'`  
List of routes and store_codes. In above example, adding url suffix /nl/ would
result in the storeview 'default' being loaded. GraphCommerce uses the browser
language to determine which storeview to load. A url suffix will be added as a
result, with the exception of the first option in the list.

> If need to fetch a list of availble store_codes, run `yarn dev` when you
> entered your `MAGENTO_ENDPOINT`. The app won't build, but the GraphQL explorer
> will start at `http://localhost:3000/api/graphql`. Enter the following query:
>
> ```graphql {3-4}
> query {
>   availableStores {
>     store_code
>     store_name
>   }
> }
> ```

### Remove unused PSP's

The example has Payment Service Providers integrated (Mollie, Braintree). Remove
the ones you don't want to use.

- Remove `"@graphcommerce/[psp]"` from package.json
- Remove all [psp] references from `pages/checkout/payment.tsx`

# Step 3: Start the development environment

- `yarn` Install the dependencies
- `yarn codegen` Converts all .graphql files to typescript files
- `yarn dev` Run the app

Visit the development environment running at http://localhost:3000  
Visit the GraphQL Playground running at http://localhost:3000/api/graphql

> No success? Refer to [common build errors](../framework/troubleshooting.md)

# Next steps

- Learn how to [Set up Visual Studio Code](../getting-started/vscode.md) and
  install usefull extensions for an optimal development experience
- [Start building a GraphCommerce custom storefront](../getting-started/start-building.md)
  by customizing text and component styles, fetching data from server
  components, and making changes to GraphQL queries.
