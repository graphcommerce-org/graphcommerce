## FAQ

<div>
<details>
<summary>Is GraphCommerce a Magento PWA theme?</summary>

### Is GraphCommerce a Magento PWA theme?

GraphCommerce is not a Magento PWA theme, nor is it a Magento 2 PWA extension. A
Magento theme is tightly integrated in the Magento codebase, where a
GraphCommerce storefront runs as a separate application.

GraphCommerce can be deployed on the same or a different server than the Magento
backend is hosted on. All data is fetched from the Magento 2 GraphQL API. Once
you finish GraphCommerce Magento PWA development and you are ready to launch,
the regular Magento front-end (theme and extensions) can be decommissioned.

<details>
<summary>Is GraphCommerce a PWA Studio Magento 2 alternative?</summary>

### Is GraphCommerce a PWA Studio Magento 2 alternative?

Yes, GraphCommerce is suitable as an alternative to Magento 2 PWA Studio.
GraphCommerce is built with modern, open-source javascript frameworks and
libraries. Unlike PWA Studio for Magento 2, it features an app-like e-commerce
user interface, Hybrid Static Site Generation (SSG) and has the ability to fetch
data from multiple sources (composable commerce).

for a PWA Studio Magento 2 alternative and would like to start with Magento PWA
development.
