## Getting Started

GraphCommerce offers a [magento-graphcms](./getting-started/readme.md) example
that provides a full-featured storefront. The example integrates with your
Magento backend and provides a full purchase journey out-of-the-box. It uses
Hygraph to enrich pages with multiple content components, like the homepage.

The magento-graphcms example is styled using the Mui component library. You can
start styling by making changes to the [theme](./framework/theming.md).

## FAQ

<summary>Is GraphCommerce a Magento PWA theme?</summary>

### Is GraphCommerce a Magento PWA theme?

GraphCommerce is not a Magento PWA theme, nor is it a Magento 2 PWA extension. A
Magento theme is tightly integrated in the Magento codebase, where a
GraphCommerce storefront runs as a separate application.

GraphCommerce can be deployed on the same or a different server than the Magento
backend is hosted on. All data is fetched from the Magento 2 GraphQL API. Once
you finish GraphCommerce Magento PWA development and you are ready to launch,
the regular Magento front-end (theme and extensions) can be decommissioned.

<summary>Is GraphCommerce a PWA Studio Magento 2 alternative?</summary>

### Is GraphCommerce a PWA Studio Magento 2 alternative?

Yes, GraphCommerce is suitable as an alternative to Magento 2 PWA Studio.
GraphCommerce is built with modern, open-source javascript frameworks and
libraries. Unlike PWA Studio for Magento 2, it features an app-like e-commerce
user interface, Hybrid Static Site Generation (SSG) and has the ability to fetch
data from multiple sources (composable commerce).
