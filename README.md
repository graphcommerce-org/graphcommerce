# GraphCommerce

GraphCommerce is an open-source headless e-commerce storefront build with
[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org),
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Next.js](ttps://nextjs.org/).

**Complete and production ready for Magento**

GraphCommerce features components for all key Magento functionality. They are
build on the Magento GraphQL API and page independent: you can theme, modify and
move them around with ease.

**Inifinite services in a single endpoint**

At the heart of GraphCommerce is our GraphQL Mesh, wich consolidates data from
different services. To date, Magento Open Source, Adobe Commerce, GraphCMS (rich
content) have been fully integrated.
